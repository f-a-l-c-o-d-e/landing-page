# landing-page
This is the second Odin Project, the purpose of which is to create a landing page.

During the creation of the page CSS properties are used to modify the style of the content, but in particular the properties belonging to flexbox, so that the positions of the various elements are set correctly. In addition, commits are created in git to document the creation of the site.
